== App Engine

This app was converted to work under Google App Engine using @woodie's
tutorial: http://gist.github.com/268192

The ActiveRecord models were converted to DataMapper to work with Big Table,
but the specs were not, so tests will fail. I also removed the rspec task
because it loads whenever the Rails stack loads up and it breaks down in the
App Engine.

To bundle the required gems, execute:

  appcfg.rb bundle --update .
  
Change the application id in 'config.ru' and 'WEB-INF/appengine-web.xml' to
the name of the application you created (http://appengine.google.com/start/createapp?)

To deploy, run:

  ./script/publish.sh
  
That should do it!
